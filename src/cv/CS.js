        info: ` My life has revolved around computers since I was a child. When I was 17 I tried to apply to an intermediate degree in computer science but there were no places left so I went another way instead (You know... that "I don't know - I don't care" mindset when you're young). But better late than never, in one of my moments of curiosity I came across a web development tutorial and I totally felt in love. I cannot stop coding since then.`,
